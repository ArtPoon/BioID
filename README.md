This undergraduate course is designed to cover a broad domain of bioinformatics as it is applied to the study of infectious diseases.  The course is structured by different topics that are anchored by recent, high-impact papers in the scientific literature.  For each paper, we will cover the overall theme, the context of the specific study, the underlying model and algorithm, and then run a simplified version of the analysis in the laboratory section.


## Learning objectives
* To develop a fundamental understanding of the concepts underlying the analysis of genetic sequence variation from infectious disease outbreaks (genetic distances, maximum likelihood).
* To gain basic command-line literacy.
* To become acquainted with popular software tools used for the analysis of infectious disease sequence data.
