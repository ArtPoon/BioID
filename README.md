# Bioinformatics of Infectious Diseases

A collection of online reference materials for an undergraduate course.

## Learning objectives
* To develop a fundamental understanding of the concepts underlying the analysis of genetic sequence variation from infectious disease outbreaks (genetic distances, maximum likelihood).
* To gain basic command-line literacy.
* To become acquainted with popular software tools used for the analysis of infectious disease sequence data.

## Outline
1. [Databases](Databases.md)
   * NCBI GenBank
   * scoring matrices
   * BLAST queries
2. [Alignment](Alignment.md)
   * Smith-Waterman and related algorithms
   * short-read mapping
3. [Genetic clustering](Clustering.md)
   * measures of diversity
   * genetic distances
   * virus nomenclature
   * molecular epidemiology
4. [Building trees](Trees.md)
   * Distance-based methods
   * Rooting (outgroup, midpoint, root-to-tip)
   * The number of trees
5. [Measuring rates of evolution](Rates.md)
   * Markov chain models
   * Rates of evolution
   * Maximum likelihood
   * Detecting selection
6. [Molecular clocks](Clocks.md)
   * Rescaling trees
