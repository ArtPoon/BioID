# Bioinformatics of Infectious Diseases

A collection of online reference materials for an undergraduate course.

## Learning objectives
* To develop a fundamental understanding of the concepts underlying the analysis of genetic sequence variation from infectious disease outbreaks (genetic distances, maximum likelihood).
* To gain basic command-line literacy.
* To become acquainted with popular software tools used for the analysis of infectious disease sequence data.

## Outline
1. Databases
   * NCBI GenBank
   * scoring matrices
   * BLAST queries
2. Alignment
   * Smith-Waterman and related algorithms
   * short-read mapping
3. Genetic clustering 
   * measures of diversity
   * genetic distances
   * virus nomenclature
   * molecular epidemiology
4. Building trees
   * Distance-based methods
   * Rooting (outgroup, midpoint, root-to-tip)
   * The number of trees
5. Fitting models
   * Markov chain models
   * Rates of evolution
   * Maximum likelihood
   * Detecting selection
6. Molecular clocks
   * Rescaling trees
   * Root-to-tip methods
   * Lineages-through-time plots, incidence
7. Epidemic models
   * Kingman's coalescent
   * Bayesian inference
   * Demographic growth models (skylines)
   * Compartmental epidemic models
