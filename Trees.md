## What is a phylogeny?

A phylogeny is a tree that represents how different populations are related by their common ancestors back in time. 
Each population is represented by a tip of the tree. 
To me, it is important to clarify that each tip represents a population, which encompasses a species or an infection, and not a single individual.
A tree that relates individuals instead of populations should be referred to as a *geneaology*, not a phylogeny.
The rationale is that individuals do not evolve - populations do. 
Although the descent of individuals from their ancestors can also be represented by a tree, there is no evolutionary process unfolding along its branches.
This distinction can be confusing because we often reconstruct the phylogenetic tree by sequencing individual representatives from each population or species.

Another way to think about the distinction between a phylogeny and a genealogy is that they are shaped by processes that operate on different time scales. 
A geneaology traces the ancestry within a population. 
Eventually, we reach an ancestor for all of the individuals whom we selected from the population. 
Frequently, that ancestor will be more recent than the time that the population became distinct from other populations. 
For example, suppose we pick two people (representatives of *Homo sapiens*). 
If we trace their ancestry back using their [mitochondrial DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA), the furthest back in time we will get is "[mitochondrial Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve)", an ancestor from roughly 150,000 years ago. 
The common ancestor of *Homo sapiens* and *H. erectus* is placed in the phylogeny roughly 315,000 years ago. 
If we choose two people who live in the same town, there is a fair possibility that they will have a great-great-grandmother in common, and we will fall well short of mitochondrial Eve. 

For another species, it is *possible* that their "Eve" predates their split from another species in the phylogeny.


## Anatomy of a phylogeny
As we follow the branch from the tip down the tree, we will eventually reach its junction with one or more other branches that represents a common ancestor. 
This juncture is called an *ancestral node* or a *split*. 
Eventually, we reach the deepest node in the tree that may represent the most recent common ancestor or *root*. 
However, a tree may be unrooted so that the meaning of the deepest node is more ambiguous (more on this later).

If there are always exactly two branches that descend from every ancestral node in the tree, then we say that it is a *binary* or *bifurcating* tree.
We make the implicit assumption that the biological process underlying splits in the tree, *e.g.,* speciation or transmission,
