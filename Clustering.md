## What are clusters?

A cluster is a subset of objects that are more similar to each other than they are to objects that are not in the cluster.
The amount of similarity that is sufficient to define a cluster is subjective, and clusters can occur entirely by chance. 
If you drop a handful of jellybeans in a bowl, your eyes will naturally be drawn to what you perceive as patterns.

## Nonparametric clustering

### Distance-based clustering


### Tree-based clustering
