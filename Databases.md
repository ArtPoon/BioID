# Databases

## Bioinformatics is about data
Bioinformatics exists because it has become increasingly more afforadble, faster and easier to generate massive amounts of complex biological data sets.
Presently, we can measure "mass" in [gigabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte), although this unit will likely become outdated in a number of years, and storage devices begin to be issued with capacities measured in petabytes instead of terabytes.  
To put this in context, a plain text file containing the human genome (encoded by the standard [IUPAC] nucleotide characters) takes up roughly 3GB on a hard drive.  
Fortunately, nucleotide sequences compress pretty well!



## What is a database?
A database is a systematic collection of data. 
Under this broad definition, a stack of papers on my desk is a database if I add papers to the pile to maintain a chronological order - it's just not a terribly useful one.


* sequences used to be kept in books
* Margaret Oakley Dayhoff
* how many printed pages would it take to record the current contents of Genbank? - calculate in Python (variable assignment and arithmetic)

* genbank

* annotations - 

* searching - storage isn't enough 
* how to query a sequence database, distance matrices
* BLAST

* local BLAST
